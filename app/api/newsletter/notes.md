The website does have a very clean layout, I really enjoy the dynimic letters and the changing background. 
However, I do not belive this aligns well with the vision for Vemos Vamos. 
There needs to be a focus on the red and cream colors that were envisioned, and the fonts wanted as well. 
Im thinking of making that background color a cream color, and including a lot more instagram content.
